# Introduction to YouTube Lounge API

This documentation was originally forked from <https://github.com/enriquecidok/youtube-lounge-api> and has been expanded with additional findings.

## Purpose

This wiki documents the reverse-engineered details of how the YouTube cast API works. It covers:

- How to discover YouTube-capable devices on a network
- Authentication and connection to the Lounge API
- Sending remote commands to control playback
- Understanding the events and responses from devices
- YouTube TV's specific implementation differences

The information here is based on observation and analysis, not official documentation from YouTube.
